Rosin:Hello
Doctor:What can I do for you?
Roisin:I've decided I want to medically transition.
<<play_animation BubbleWindow blink>>
Doctor:Have we met before, or is this your first visit to the Gender Clinic?
Roisin:This is my first time here.
Doctor:Okay… 
Roisin:Is that bad?
Doctor:No,no...let’s get started. What is your name?
Roisin:Roisin.
Doctor:Roisin... That’s nice, is it your birth name?
Roisin:No.
Doctor:What's your birth name?
Roisin:...████. It should be on the referal...
Doctor:Okay, do you go by Roisin at home? What is your home life like?
Roisin:Yeah, and it’s okay. My parents don’t mind.
Doctor:How did they react to you coming out?
Roisin:…um I don't really want to talk about that.
Doctor:Okay,We’ll come back to that one. 
Doctor:Can you describe your dysphoria? How does it make you feel?
Roisin:It feels horrible. I don't like to focus on it, but it’s always there.
<<set_emotion_state BubbleWindow uncomfortable>>
Doctor:Can you be more specific? I need to understand how badly it affects you.

Doctor:I see...
Doctor:And how is your mental health? Do you take any medication for that?
Roisin:No, I'm doing okay.
Doctor:Do you think hormones would help your mental health?
Roisin:...um, well...I'm not sure.
<<set_emotion_state BubbleWindow neutral>>
Roisin:I think it would help with my dysphoria, I don't know if it would help with my mental health.
Doctor:Hormones will likely affect your libido. 
Doctor:Do you think that would be a problem for you? 
Roisin:...I don't know. I guess it depends on how much it changes me.
Doctor:How does your dysphoria affect you during intimacy? 
<<set_emotion_state BubbleWindow uncomfortable>>
Roisin:It's hard to be intimate with anybody when I feel like this.
Doctor:Okay, so you don't feel comfortable being intimate with anyone?
Roisin:Sometimes, but not all the time. It's hard to explain.
Doctor:Well, are you sexually active now? Do you watch pornography?

Doctor:Okay...and what about kids? Do you want to have children?
Roisin:I don't think I want to have children.
Doctor:Are you sure? Do you plan on having surgery? Don't you want to preserve your fertility? 
Roisin:I'm still deciding on the surgery, but I dont think I want to have kids. 
Doctor:It sounds like you're not sure what you want.
Roisin:But I am sure what I want. I just didn't know I had to have the answers to all these questions before I came here.
Roisin:And I don't know what any of this has to do with starting my transition.
Doctor:I'm just not comfortable prescribing you this medication today.
Roisin:Why not?
Doctor:Because I'm not satisfied that there's enough evidence of gender dysphoria to justify the treatment.
Roisin:But why don't you believe me?

Roisin:Hello.
Doctor:Hello Roisin, is this your first visit? 
Roisin:Yes.
Doctor:Excellent, so what can I do for you?
Roisin:I've decided I want to medically transition.
Doctor:Okay...let's get a blood test done and talk about your options. 
Doctor:Are you aware of the potential side effects of the hormones?
Roisin:Yes, and I'm happy to proceed.
Doctor:Okay that's great. Do you have any questions about this treatment?
Roisin:Yes, how long will it take for the hormones to take effect?
Doctor:It can take up to three months to start seeing results, but it varies from person to person.
Doctor:If you're worried about any of the effects of the medication, please let me know.
Roisin:Okay, I will. Thank you.
Roisin:So, what happens next?
Doctor:Your bloods look fine, so if you're still happy to go ahead, I'll write you a prescription.
Doctor:You can start taking the medication right away.
Doctor:But do come back to me if you need anything else. 
Roisin:Thank you, I will!

CharacterName: Hey, how's it going?
Doctor: Welcome back. 
CharacterName: I've been told I need to see you again before I can transition. 
Doctor: Yes, are you ready to start the assessment?
CharacterName: I suppose I am. I don't really have a choice do I?
Doctor: Well, let's begin. What is your name?
CharacterName:  Dáithí.
Doctor: Is that your birth name? 
CharacterName: It's my name. 
Doctor: I've got "████" on your records. 
<<set_emotion_state BubbleWindow uncomfortable>>
CharacterName: I don't use that anymore.
Doctor: This is just a formality for the paperwork.
CharacterName: Fine.
Doctor: So, what is your home life like?
<<set_emotion_state BubbleWindow neutral>>
CharacterName: It's nice. I have my own place, and a little garden. Lots of peace and quiet when you live alone. 
Doctor: Okay... so no children?
CharacterName: Nope.
Doctor: Do you plan on having any?
CharacterName: Nope.

CharacterName: I said I don't plan to have kids. I know what my options are.
Doctor: Have you considered freezing your eggs, in case you change your mind in the future?
CharacterName: What makes you think I'll change my mind in the future? I came here for a reason. 
Doctor: A lot of women express regret later in life for not having children. 
<<set_emotion_state BubbleWindow angry>>
CharacterName: I'm not "a lot of women". I'm not a woman. 
Doctor: Hmm...Do you feel dysphoric when you think of motherhood and what that entails?
CharacterName: Sure. But I don't want to have children. That's all there is to it. 
Doctor: Many of my patients say that children are a blessing. Here, let me show you a photo of my family...

Doctor: It's my job to make sure that your dysphoria isn't holding you back from living a normal life. 
CharacterName: What's holding me back from living a normal life is everyone telling me I can't transition!
CharacterName: How long do you expect me to wait? What do you need me to say?
Doctor: I just need you to be honest with me. Are you getting upset?
CharacterName: Of course I am. This is ridiculous. I'm asking you to help me medically transition.
Doctor: I just don't think you've given this enough consideration. 
<<set_emotion_state BubbleWindow uncomfortable>>
CharacterName: I've considered this, over and over. Give me a break. 
Doctor: Do you have a partner? 
CharacterName: No. 
Doctor: What if you meet someone, fall in love, and they want children? 
Doctor: You need to really think about what transitioning means for your fertility, for your future.

Doctor: Hello again. 
CharacterName: Hi there.
Doctor: How is the job going?
CharacterName: It's great, lots of new customers since the old sabatoir closed. 
Doctor: Glad to hear it! 
Doctor: I understand you want to begin your transition, is that right?
CharacterName: Yep. That's right. 
Doctor: You probably already know this, but undergoing this treatment will affect your fertility. 
Doctor: Have you given any thought to having children in the future?
CharacterName: Yes, and I've decided that I defintely don't want to have kids. 
Doctor: As long as you're happy with that decision, that's all that matters. 
Doctor: But if you do decide that you want to explore other options, such as freezing your eggs, let me know, okay?
CharacterName: I will. Thank you. 
CharacterName: If I do decide that I want to have kids, what are my options?
Doctor: Great! If you're ready to get started, let's get a blood test and look at precription options.

Doctor: Hello Fiadh, how are you today?
CharacterName: I'm okay, a little nervous maybe.
Doctor: What are you feeling nervous about?
CharacterName: I think I'm about ready to start my transition, finally.
CharacterName: But uh, it looks like I'm the only one at home that's happy about it. 
Doctor: What do you mean by that?
CharacterName: Ah, it's just my wife, this whole thing has been hard on her...
CharacterName: Thankfully the kids aren't really old enough to understand it yet. 
Doctor: So you've spoken with her about transitioning?
CharacterName: Well, she knows how I feel, but I didn't tell her I'd be coming here today.
Doctor: Why not?
CharacterName: She's worried about what people will think of our family. 
Doctor: Well, your transition would be a big shock for everyone involved, don't you think? 
CharacterName: I know, but I don't know what else I'm supposed to do.
Doctor: How old are your children?
CharacterName: Three and seven. They keep us busy, but they're great kids.
Doctor: So they're quite young. Your seven year old will be going back to school in a few weeks, right?
CharacterName: Yes, and that's part of it, too. She says that the other parents will start to talk about us. 
CharacterName: Maybe even tell their children to avoid our boys. 
Doctor: Hmm, unfortunately that's not an unreasonable assumption to make. 
Doctor: It sounds like your wife's just trying to protect her family.

CharacterName: I want to protect my family too, but I think it's important to be honest about how I feel, you know?
Doctor: Of course. Has your wife asked you to reconsider transitioning?
CharacterName: Yes, and she doesn't want me to come out to the kids yet either.
Doctor: How does that make you feel?
CharacterName: Honestly? Angry. She doesn't understand that I can't keep feeling like this. Like I'm in a pressure cooker. 
Doctor: Can you postpone making this decision until the kids get a little older?
CharacterName: What? No.
CharacterName: She's suggesting I wait until they finish school. That's years away!
Doctor: But there's no need to rush into a decision, it's okay to find the right time. 
CharacterName: There's never a "right time"! I've gone my whole life hiding who I am just so everyone else can be comfortable.
Doctor: What do you mean by that?
CharacterName: My parents told me they'd never accept me if I came out, so I kept it a secret for years because I didn't want to hurt them.
CharacterName: Now they're gone, and my wife wants me to do the same thing for her and the kids.
CharacterName: I love them, but I can't keep pretending. 
Doctor: Do you have any other family that you can talk to about this?
CharacterName: No. My brother and I don't talk anymore.
Doctor: That's a pity. You know, you really need a support system if you're going to go through with this.

CharacterName: Hang on, you said this is my decision, right?
Doctor: Yes, but I want you to be sure that you're making the right decision for you.
CharacterName: But I am sure. That's why I came here. 
Doctor: Listen, I know that you're upset about your wife's reaction, but I think you need to give her time to process this.
CharacterName: I don't want to give anyone else more time.
CharacterName: This is about my life, not anyone else's.
Doctor: Please, be reasonable. It's going to be very difficult for you to go through this alone.
CharacterName: I'm not alone. I have my kids, and my wife and I will work through this ourselves. 
Doctor: But is that realistic?
Doctor: You've said you don't have any other family, your wife isn't ready to support you, and your kids are too young to make sense of it.
Doctor: I'm just not confident that you won't feel isolated.
CharacterName: But I do feel isolated. Everyone else wants me to keep on being a "good husband" and "good father" instead of being myself."
CharacterName: I'm done waiting for permission, so why can't you just help me?
Doctor: Well, you're putting me in a difficult position, for one. I've got a duty of care to you and your family.
CharacterName: I can't believe this. I know I said that my wife doesn't approve but this is not her decision. 
CharacterName: If anything you have a duty of care to me. I'm the one who needs help! 
Doctor: Listen, that's enough. I think you need to go home, take some time and space, and talk this through with your wife.

Doctor: Hello, how are you today?
CharacterName: I'm okay, a little nervous maybe. 
Doctor: What are you feeling nervous about?
CharacterName: I think I'm about ready to start my transition, finally.
CharacterName: But I've been talking to my wife about it, and she's not exactly thrilled.
Doctor: I see. How did she react?
CharacterName: She got upset.  I think she feels like I'm abandoning her and the kids.
CharacterName: But that couldn't be further from the truth. I love them so much, and I want to do this for them, too.
Doctor: That's understandable. It sounds like you're in a difficult position.
CharacterName: A little bit. She's also worried that people will treat me differently, and that it will affect our kids at school.
Doctor: I see, that's a common concern. What do you think about that?
CharacterName: I know it's going to be a big change for all of us, but I think it's going to be better in the long run.
Doctor: You've got a good outlook. That's important. 
Doctor: Do you have any other family that you can talk to about this?
CharacterName: No. My brother and I don't talk anymore.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It can be really helpful to have a support system in place when you're starting your transition. 
Doctor: Have you thought about joining a support group? I can provide you with some resources if you're interested.
CharacterName: I think that would be really helpful.
Doctor: You might also consider talking to a therapist about your feelings, or even a family therapist to help you and your wife work through this together.
CharacterName: I hadn't considered that, but I think that might be a good idea.
Doctor: I know that it's not a nice thought, but will you still want to go through with your transition if your wife doesn't support you?
CharacterName: I've been thinking about that, and yes, I think I will.
CharacterName: I've spent a long time hiding who I am, and I don't want to do that anymore.
Doctor: That's a brave decision.I think it's important to be true to yourself, even if it means making difficult choices.
CharacterName: Thank you. I really appreciate your support.
